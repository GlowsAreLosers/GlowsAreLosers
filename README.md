Introduction
============

Mass-scale remote mind reading and manipulation is a reality now.

No, this is not a conspiracy theory. This is the absolute reality that absolutely
everyone where I currently live knows and sees as a part of their everyday lives
now, which has in fact been the case for several years already.

If you haven't heard of it yet, chances are, they're rolling it out where you
live too, but they haven't revealed it to you yet. Most probably they will reveal
it to you in the next few years, after making sure that they have disempowered
and confused you enough to think that you are helpless against it.

So let me spill the beans to you before that happens, and maybe you'll be able
to defend some of your rights before it's too late... unlike my outrageously
moronic people who collectively decided to surrender all their will, liberty,
dignity and humanity to the regime, and consequently are living in an absolute
fucking hellscape now thanks to their cowardice.

I'm going to explain everything you need to know: the nature of the technology,
what can be done with it, how it is being used and abused, the motivations behind
those abuses, the scale of absolute lunacy that my entire country has plummeted
into, and finally, what you can do to counter it and at least prevent it from
going that bad where you live.


This Needs to Go Viral
======================

I used a git repository to make it easy for myself to publish and update the
content, as well as to make it easy for others to replicate the content by
cloning the repository and reuploading/sharing it in as many places as possible.

Please share this repository with everyone you know. The whole world needs to
know. Victims of this system are being tormented everyday, but are often
incapable of even proving that this is happening, let alone garnering any
assistance. This repository aims to contain a fairly comprehensive introduction
about the subject, which a victim can easily link to in order to allow people
to understand what they're talking about.

The whole world needs to know about this. The regime gets to abuse whoever it
wants now because they are isolated and disempowered, which in no small part is
because they spend years without even understanding what is being done to them,
let being able to communicate it to the rest of society.

But when both the victims and everyone around them acquires a complete
understanding of what is going on, and they form a community and come together
against the regime, things become very different. With a huge social media
backlash, and with everything they are doing being continuously exposed to
a large mass of people, even the biggest shitheads in this regime will back
off and fear negative publicity and retaliation.

At the very least, they will learn to think twice before they abuse you when
they realize that you have become fully capable of publicly shaming them.

Continue Beyond Me
------------------

To be fully transparent with you, my health is in a terrible state now, to the
point I suspect that I might be dead in the next 24 hours, which is why I had to
rush uploading the repository long before it's finished. In case I do not show
up again for the next week, then I'm most certainly dead.

Several articles are either fully blank or are very minimally written. In case
I do not appear again, please do not let this endeavor die. The repository needs
a community of people to contribute and make it complete. And more importantly,
please replicate it as much as possible so that it doesn't get taken down!

I hope you manage to fend off all harm from yourself, and regain control over
your life.
