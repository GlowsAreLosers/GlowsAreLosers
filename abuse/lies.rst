The regime employs extensive (and in fact, automated with AI) deception about
its motives. It spends years lying to the victims about why they are being
abused, and lies to everyone around them about the reasons as well.

The abusers are absolutely not one little bit interested in any truth. If the
victim proves their innocence, the abusers swiftly jump to the next lie and
continue their abuse as if nothing happened.

The reasons behind the lies are numerous. They often aim to gaslight,
intimidate, demoralize, or "mind-break" the victim. At other times they
tell lies to mislead the victim into taking the wrong decision, which
in the right context would be used to "erupt in anger" over the victim
for having made the wrong decision (even though they intentionally deceived
and mislead the victim into making it).

Lies also help the culprits maintain the appearance that they believe they
are right about everything, when they are internally completely malicious,
immoral, and never interested in any sort of rightfulness or rationality.

I'm not even kidding, that's the level of integrity you can expect out of this
regime.

This article enumerates some of the lies that the regime employs in their abuse
of the victims, and in their deception of the people around them.


1. It's the victim's fault
--------------------------

This one is "abusive piece of shit 101" material. Everything is the victim's
fault, period. Even if 99% of the time, it's clear to any sane person that
it can't possibly be the case.

It doesn't matter that they spent all day long eating shit and incessantly
coming up with every nonsensical and frivolous excuse to humiliate you.
If after the hours of abuse, you become instigated in any way, then **you**
are the devil! And "that's why" they've had a burning grudge against you
for the last 10 years!


2. The victim is "suspected" for something
------------------------------------------

This is probably what they claim when they start revealing themselves to you.
Rest assured that they had been reading your mind (and the rest of the
population's) for **years** before that, and they know for a fact that there
has never, ever been anything suspicious about you.

And FYI, pretending to "suspect" people who are known to be innocent has been
in the playbook of tyrannical regimes for decades.
