leaks about it? And the answer is: You bet!

While according to the article the leaker did not communicate with the website
again after having sent them those images, but it still originated from the
Washington State Fusion Center. It's incredibly unlikely that somebody was
just fooling around.

Remember: The fact that they can now read minds means that leaks have become
a lot more difficult to happen, as they would immediately stalk and threaten
anyone if they realize that he/she is even *thinking* about leaking something.

Nevertheless, the above leak happened.
