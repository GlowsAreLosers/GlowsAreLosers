 Reading Capabilities
===============================================================================

- Complete decoding of conscious thinking, whether verbalized or not.

- Complete transcription of one's inner monologue.

- Identification of intent, even if it's not verbalized. For example wanting
  to get up and do something, or wanting to initiate a conversation; and even
  "passive" intents like wanting to not respond or deciding to not react to
  something.

- Decoding of visual perception, whether its source is vision, memory
  or imagination.

- Decoding of audio perception, including the sounds you hear, remember
  or imagine.

- Decoding of somatic sensory perception, including that coming from physical
  stimuli, memory, imagination.

- Decoding of all sorts of emotions and what I call "virtual sensations" that
  are activated in the cortex as a reaction to thoughts, emotions or experiences. 
  From general moods like joy, sadness or anger, to everything else you perceive
  "in your body", like goosebumps, "pins-and-needles", sexual stimulation.

 Manipulation Capabilities
===============================================================================

(Before I start I want to set something aside, which is that they do **not** have
the ability to control your thinking - at least not directly. This is discussed
more in the `limitations <./limitations.rst>`_ article.)


Visual
======

Inducing visual perception and visual phenomena, both during wakefulness and
sleep (i.e. hallucination and dreaming, respectively). They can also cause your
vision to black out, make you see "television static", induce an artificial
blurring in any segment in your vision, superimpose visual artifacts and effects
like flashing, and even beam waveforms that manipulate the interpretation of
existing objects in your vision - e.g. make something seem briefly larger or
smaller than it is, alter its perceived position, make it seem like it's moving,
or alter the perceived colors in your view (what I'm going to liken to an
Instagram filter being applied to your vision).


Audio
=====

Inducing audio perception and phenomena. This includes the well-known high-
pitched buzzing sound ("microwave hearing"), voice-to-skull (v2k), audio
hallucinations, and various "effects" like altering the perceived loudness or
location/direction of the sounds that you are hearing, and causing your hearing
to black out.


Sensory
=======

They can induce all sorts of sensory perceptions and phenomena, which includes
way more things than you'd realize is possible, because the somatic sensory
cortex in the human brain has a surprisingly vast range of functions.

This includes:

- **Primary sensory phenomena:** Anything you can ever experience from physical
  stimuli, like touch, heat, cold, pressure.

- **Interpretative sensory perceptions:** This includes various "feelings" that
  you may experience in your body, for example feeling like your arm is "tired"
  and needs to rest (which normally would happen after some workout), or feeling
  like your limb is "about to fall" (which you'd normally experience e.g. if
  you're on the edge of your bed), or feeling that **your entire body** is about
  to fall (which would normally happen if you lose your balance), or feeling
  that a part of your body is "unwell" (which would normally happen if you have
  an illness or infection of some sort in there), and much more.

- **Systemic sensory perceptions**: Like fatigue, dizziness, hunger, feeling
  "unwell" or "sick", and really any systemic feeling you can experience.

- **Other sensory phenomena:** Like pins-and-needles, and feelings of (unreal)
  "electricity" in your body.

- **Altering the perception of intensity:** In addition to the type of
  sensation, your brain's waveforms encode the perceived **intensity** of a
  sensation. The technology can be used to beam arbitrary intensity information,
  which causes perceived sensations to appear far more more intense or far less
  intense than they actually are.

- **Numbing of sensations:** The brain can secrete substances that block sensory
  neural paths for a select area, causing a sedation effect. This can naturally
  occur, for example, when a person suffers an extremely painful injury, in
  which case the brain secretes those substances to reduce the extreme pain.
  The technology can force the brain it to secrete those substances, which
  results in an unnatural numbing in select areas, or throughout the entire
  body. The numbing is temporary, and typically goes away merely seconds after
  the signal stops, but the signal can be sustained to make the numbing persist
  for hours.


Psychological
=============

Pretty much every emotional state you can think of, and even ones you have never
seen before - joy, anger, sadness, anxiety, feeling that one is "not alright",
feelings of doubt, feelings of unconfidence, feeling helpless - they can all be
beamed into your brain.

Many other psychological effects can be induced as well.

Every cognitive event that occurs in your mind while you're thinking has a
unique waveform identifying it. For example, realizing that you arrived at a
conclusion, or the opposite - feeling that "something is still missing" or
that "something is wrong" with the conclusion. The technology can be used to
beam the waveform for the "something is wrong/missing" perceptions to the
victim's brain, possibly causing the victim to second-guess themselves, or
to feel unrelieved about their conclusion even if they know that it's 100%
correct.

The technology can be used to beam feelings of doubt, fear, insecurity,
danger, anxiety, etc. to cause the victim to stay restless. It can also
induce the feeling of being "psychologically tired", or the feeling that
"you do not want to do anything".

Typically this is performed on victims for years without their knowledge,
making them believe that they have an uncontrollable anxiety disorder that
impedes their social, occupational or mental functioning, when in reality
it's all being artificially reinforced by beaming psychological effects
to them in an automated manner, typically timed after any thoughts that
would appear to be the cause of those feelings to the victim.


Motor
=====

The technology can be used to beam motor commands to the victim's brain,
which can induce forced movement, forced speech, or the opposite - forced
limping of the muscles, or forced contraction to restrict movement.

The technology allows **far** more fine-grained control than what is possible
with conscious will. For example, with your conscious will, you can flex an
entire muscle, or a large section of it, but this technology allows controlling
**each individual point in the muscle separately**. This can be used to induce
many effects that are impossible with voluntary control. Some examples
include:

- What I call the "raindrops effect": Individual points in the muscle are
  made to flex at regular intervals with different phases, which causes
  a movement that feels like raindrops falling on the muscle. This effect
  can be done in any part of the body - for example, the biceps or legs,
  but it appears that the abusers have a preference for doing it on the
  back the majority of the time.

- The throbbing effect: An individual point or region is made to alternate
  between flexing and relaxing at a regular pace.

- The "waves effect": This is possibly the strangest-feeling of all of them.
  A wave-like shape is swept along the entire length of a typically long
  muscle (such as a bicep) back and forth at a regular interval.

- The "kneading effect": This is similar to the raindrops effect, but rather
  than individual points, it's applied to larger regions, and typically at a
  slower pace, which feels as if the area is being "kneaded".

- Forced expansion or contraction of the eye lens: The eye lens is controlled
  by tiny muscles surrounding it, which are controlled by the brain. By sending
  neural commands to those muscles, the eye lens may be forcefully expanded or
  contracted, causing the victim's vision to become blurred.

- Ocular muscles: The eye is controlled by four muscles (one in each direction,
  which allow the eye to be moved in all four directions), and those muscles are
  controlled by the brain. Naturally, when you control them with your conscious
  will, they are moved in sync. e.g. To rotate the eyeball to the left, the
  muscle to the left of the eyeball contracts while the one to the right of
  the eyeball relaxes.

  With this technology, the muscles can be moved individually, disregarding the
  usual rules. If muscles from two opposite directions both flex at the same
  time, the eyeball is squeezed. Fortunately the ocular muscles are not powerful
  enough to rupture the eyeball or cause a lot of pain, but the slight squeezing
  they cause can be mildly disturbing, and results in (temporarily) deforming
  the retina, which changes the places where light falls on it, causing the view
  to appear slightly "wrinkled", or to blurred in some places but not others.

- Movement of **internal muscles**: Such as the stomach or intestines, again
  with surprising fine control. The muscles can be made to vibrate fast (which
  produces a rumbling sound in the abdomen), and they can be made to squeeze
  air to force it to move along the intestine.
