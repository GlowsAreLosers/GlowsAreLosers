 Myths About The Technology
===============================================================================

This is a collection of commonly held misconceptions about the technology, along
with a well-founded explanations as to why they are most probably incorrect.
It's important to read this if you are a victim, since being deceived about its
nature can be a vehicle for abusing and disempowering you.


1. It's a Sonic Weapon
----------------------

Make no mistake, the sound that you keep hearing all the time is not a sound at
all. It is an illusion of sound produced by beaming electromagnetic signals to
your temporal cortex (that's where audio perception occurs in your brain) at a
frequency that your cortex understands and reacts to.


2. They use Chemicals to Induce Psychological Effects
-----------------------------------------------------

I've seen victims say that the perpetrators are spraying them with "chemicals"
that cause them psychological effects. The perpetrators certainly received
commands to spray you with something, but that something is most likely just
water or a perfume or some other harmless substance.

The psychological effects you are experiencing after being sprayed are not due
to the chemicals, but rather, they are being directly beamed to your brain
electromagnetically.
