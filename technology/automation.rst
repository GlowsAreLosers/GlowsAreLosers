Considering the sheer scale of deployment, with millions of people being
puppeteered and tens of thousands of people being tormented, I do not think
that a reasonably sized team of individual humans that is single-handedly capable
of puppeteering all of that havoc in real time.

And considering the humanly impossible latency for thousands of reactions I
received from them at this point (with some of them being no more than a 100
milliseconds after the thought that triggered them), it is very clear that this
much scale and accuracy is only possible via automation.

We live in an age where automation is pretty damn easy. There are countless ways
to do it, but based on my personal experience as a targeted individual, my
conjecture is that their automation likely employs a combination of technologies
in an architecture designed for incredibly low-latency throughput.

My experience suggests that they make extensive of the so-called genetic
behavioral neural networks (or something equivalent, or possibly even more
advanced). Basically this it tries out all possible outputs in all possible
combinations, in all possible timing patterns. For the uninitiated, `here's
a (completely unrelated) example video randomy picked from YouTube
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcYLT37ImBY>`_, which demos one such neural
network being trained to play a video game, while explaining key concepts
and nuances in an easy-to-understand manner.
